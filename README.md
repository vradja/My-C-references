Pure Virtual Functions are mostly used to define:

a) abstract classes

These are base classes where you have to derive from them and then implement the pure virtual functions.

b) interfaces

These are 'empty' classes where all functions are pure virtual and hence you have to derive and then implement all of the functions.
