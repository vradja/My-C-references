# Pure Virtual Functions are mostly used to define:
a) abstract classes: These are base classes where you have to derive from them and then implement the pure virtual functions.
b) interfaces: These are 'empty' classes where all functions are pure virtual and hence you have to derive and then implement all of the functions.
